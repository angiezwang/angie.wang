Former Sheriff Joe Arpaio leaves the federal courthouse on Thursday, July 6, 2017, in Phoenix. The former Maricopa County sheriff's criminal trial concluded Thursday. Arpaio is charged with misdemeanor contempt of court for violating a 2011 order to stop the patrols that a judge later determined racially profiled Latinos.
