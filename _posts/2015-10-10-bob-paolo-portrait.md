*This portrait ran as part of "A Paper Trail," the ninth Daily Bruin reporting project funded by the [Bridget O'Brien Scholarship Foundation](http://rememberingbridget.com/). "A Paper Trail" aims to illustrate what it means to be an undocumented student in the United States â€“ from California, where policies are relatively lenient, to Georgia, where students are subject to some of the nation's harshest higher education policies.

Paolo Jara-Riveros immigrated to California with his mother when he was 15 years old. He has since joined the National Immigrant Youth Alliance, an advocacy organization for undocumented youth that aims to bring back young undocumented students who have been deported.
