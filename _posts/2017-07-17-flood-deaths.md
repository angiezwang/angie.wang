A Navajo County rescuer searches the riverbank under the bridge where one body was recovered in Tonto National Forest, Ariz. Rescuers continue the search for a missing 27-year-old Hector Garnica, who was swept downriver with nine relatives when floodwaters inundated the area on Saturday. Their bodies were recovered, but Garnica remains missing.
